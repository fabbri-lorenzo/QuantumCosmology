\subsection{$P(X,\phi)$ theories}\label{sec:Pxphi}
\textcolor{darkgreen}{$X \equiv 1/2(\partial_{\mu} \phi)^2 \qquad E \equiv 2XP_X -P$}. Action for $P(X,\phi)$ theories is 
\begin{eqopt}
    S = \int d^4x \sqrt{g}\left[\frac{M_P^2}{2} R + P (X,\phi)\right]
\end{eqopt}
Equations of motion for $g^{\mu\nu}$ and $\phi$ are
\begin{equation}
    H^2 = \frac{1}{3M_P^2}E \qquad \dot{E} = -3H\left(E+P\right)
\end{equation}
Find expression for $\epsilon$ and condition for $\epsilon \ll 1$.

In fluid mechanics the speed of sound is defined as a derivative of the pressure with
respect to the density at fixed entropy per particle:
\textcolor{darkgreen}{$c_s^2 = \frac{\partial P}{\partial \rho}\big|_{s/n}$} .
It is the velocity at which adiabatic compression and rarefaction waves propagate
in a medium~\cite{piattellaNoteThermodynamicsSpeed2014}.
\begin{equation}
    c_s^2 = \frac{P_X dX + P_\phi d\phi}{\rho_X dX + \rho_\phi d\phi}\Bigg|_{s/n} = \frac{P_X}{\rho_X} = \frac{P_{X}}{P_X + 2XP_{XX}}
\end{equation}
As one can prove that $d(s/n)=0$ is equivalent to $d\phi = 0$. In our context, $c_s$ is the speed of scalar perturbations.

%K-Inflation models
\begin{mycolorbox}[orange!50!black]
    \textbf{K-Inflation models:}

    Effective kinetic Lagrangian can be written as
    \begin{eqopt}
        \mathcal{L} \supset  \sum_{n\geq1}  f(\phi)\frac{X^n}{\Lambda^{4n-4}} 
    \end{eqopt}
$\Lambda$ is the cut-off scale of the effective field theory because $\Lambda^4 \gg X$ kills everything execpt the first term, which is the one of slow roll inflation.
But there are potential problems with ghosts and radiative stability.
\end{mycolorbox}    
%DBI Inflation
\begin{mycolorbox}[orange!50!black]
    \textbf{Dirac-Born-Infeld Inflation:}

    It is a model of inflation based on the Dirac-Born-Infeld (DBI) action, which describes the dynamics of a D-brane in string theory. 
    \begin{eqopt}
        S = -\int d^4x \sqrt{g} \left[ \frac{1}{f(\phi)} \sqrt{1 + f(\phi) \partial_\mu\phi\partial^\mu\phi} - \frac{1}{f(\phi)} + V(\phi) \right]
    \end{eqopt}
    The DBI action includes a kinetic term that is non-linear in the field velocity, leading to a speed limit on the field's motion (due to $\sqrt{\dots}$). This non-linear kinetic term can give rise to an effective sound speed that is less than one (which is constrained by observations!), allowing for a more gradual roll of the inflaton field and potentially addressing issues related to the generation of primordial perturbations.
