\emph{The inflaton field $\phi$ couples to gravity and maybe also to other fields inducing quantum corrections to the tree level potential; the latter can always be written to obey slow roll conditions $V_\phi, V_{\phi\phi} \ll V$. Now we require $ V_{tot} = V_{tree} + \delta V$ to obey these conditions.}

Consider two scalar fields $\phi$ and $\psi$ (with a trilinear coupling) with masses $m$ and $M \gg m$.
\begin{eqopt}
    \mathcal{L} \supset -\frac{m^2}{2}\phi^2 - \frac{M^2}{2}\psi^2 - g\phi^2\psi
\end{eqopt}
Eliminate $\psi$ in terms of $\phi$ using the equations of motion to find $V_{\text{eff}}(\phi) = \overbracket{\frac{m}{2}\phi^2}^{\text{tree level}} +\overbracket{\frac{g^2}{M^2}\phi^4}^{\text{quant corr}}$
In general,
\begin{eqopt}[darkred]
    V_{\text{eff}}(\phi) = V_{\text{tree}} + \sum_{q=1} g_q \left(\frac{\phi}{M}\right)^q M^4
\end{eqopt}
\underline{Assume $M \sim M_P$ and $V_{\text{tree}}= m^2 \phi^2 /2$} and fix $\phi = 15M_P$ such that $N_{tot} = 60$. To make sure $V_{tot}$ obeys slow roll conditions evaluate $\frac{\delta V}{V_{tree}}$ and ask it to be $\ll 1$ so that $V_{tot} \sim V_{tree}$.
\emph{Problem of UV sensitivity of inflation: coupling $g_q$ needs to be very small otherwise quantum corrections are not negligible. This is a problem of the theory, not of the model. It means is hard to keep inflation light.}
